However, the text discusses how habits form based on frequency, not time, and it emphasizes that once a habit is formed, it often determines the choices we make. If someone were to develop a habit of walking slowly, they might find it difficult to break that habit and start walking quickly or even walk backwards, as their brain has established a pattern of walking slowly. But without specific information about walking slowly but never backward, this answer is speculative and based on general interpretations from the provided context.\n",

However, based on the discussion about reducing friction associated with habits and designing one's environment for success, it seems that in this context, the emphasis is on how one's environment can significantly impact their habits and overall well-being. So, in a sense, the \"environment\" matters more when it comes to simplifying one's life and achieving success. This is achieved by designing an environment that aligns with one's goals and reduces the friction associated with one's habits.\n",
